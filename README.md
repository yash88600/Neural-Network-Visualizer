# Neural-Network-Visualizer
Web App to Visualize Neural Network

The web app helps to visualize the output of every layer/filter.This helps to better understand the network. <br />
By visualizing the output of every layer one can better understand the effect of each layer/type of layer on the Input. <br />

I have used the **streamlit library** to design the UI of the Web App. Streamlit is very simple and easy to use,With just few lines of code of can develop a good UI for their Web App.

## To run the Web App
- install the streamlit library
~~~ 
pip install streamlit
~~~
- then run the following command on cmd: 
~~~
streamlit run stream.py
~~~
- then provide the path to the model and upload the image

### UI and results
